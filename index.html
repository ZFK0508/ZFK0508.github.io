      <h2>Personal information</h2>
      <p>My name is Fengke Zhan. I come from Shenzhen, a city lies in south of China which is next to
        Hongkong. My major is Information Technology and it's my first year in RMIT. Honestly I have
        never been to overseas yet and my English is not that well. It's hard for me to understand some
        internet slang that my classmates or teachers saying and sometime I am really confusing what they
        are talking about. But learning about different culture is interesting for me.
        </br></br>
        I also have many hobbies like traveling, playing basketball(though not good at it) and playing
        video games, espiceally FPS games such as CSGO or APEX. My first FPS game is CS1.5, I play it
        when I was 6. However, my favorite video game is Destiny2 which I have played for more than 1000
        hours. Except for games, I also like reading some science fictions espiceally about the universe.
        It makes me can't help to think about the secrets of the universe and I believe that IT can help us
        figure out more secrets about the univers.

    <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>I start to interest in IT since I was 6. When I first time access to video games, I
        started to wonder what IT can do more. When I grow up, I read a book about Bill Gates. As we all
        known, Microsoft exactly benefit people's lives. I also want to use IT to convenient daily lives and
        make more fun.
      </li>
    </br>
      <li>
        Australia is the home of WIFI which brings a lot of convenience to our lives and I believe that RMIT
        is a very good university with a long history can help me learn a lot about IT. Also, my school in
        China has collaboration with RMIT which make me have a chance to go to RMIT.
      </li>
    </br>
      <li>
        First of all, I want to learn the method of learning during my studies. Logical mind, programming
        skills like Java, Python and c++, how to build an AI are also what I expect to learn in RMIT.

    <h2>Project Idea</h2>

    <h3 style="color: rgb(11, 132, 180);">Overview:</h3>
    <p>
      This project is building a platform for children to programming and learn programming through 
      making the code into icons. Icons can let children easier to understand what its function 
      so that children can combine the codes like LEGO which can attract children’s interest. 
      Children can check the code and its meaning by clicking the icons if they want to learn more 
      and customize icons. Children can create games or programs and share on the platform. 
      They can also share their experience about building games or programs on the platform. 
      More than that, the platform can provide lessons for children about programming and some 
      programming games.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color: rgb(11, 132, 180);">Motivation:</h3>
    <p>
      Nowadays, people can’t live without smart devices and apps on them. Relatively, the demand of 
      learning programming is growing. The world will need more and more developers. In Europe 
      alone, there will be over 800,000 ICT job vacancies (Balanskat and Engelhard, 2015). Many 
      parents start to let their children learn programming. Let children learn programming 
      can help them make a good preparation for their careers or inspire their interest of 
      programming. However, it’s boring when start learning programming. If make the codes 
      become some icons or make programming like games can inspire children’s interest. 
      Plass et al. (2015) states that “...it involves the use of game elements, such as incentive 
      systems, to motivate players to engage in a task they otherwise would not find attractive.” 
      Children can learn better if they have more interest in something. Also, communicate with 
      others can also help children learn better.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color: rgb(11, 132, 180);">Description:</h3>
    <p>
      First of all, users should register an account to login the platform. There is a module for 
      users to programming. In the module, users can program via dragging and dropping icons form 
      the bar on the left. Each icon has different meanings and code inside like for loop or some 
      basic code. Users can check the code inside by double clicking the icon. Combining icons to 
      build a whole program. In order to avoid some grammar mistakes, some icons can only combine 
      with specific icons. Visual programming is easier for users to figure out what the logic of 
      the program but it’s hard to learn how the codes achieve the function. To fix this, users 
      can customize icons by written codes inside the icons to achieve specific function. Also, 
      users can choose different programming languages inside the icons like Java, C/C++ or Python. 
      However, this is more suitable for advanced students. Besides, users can convert the 
      combinatorial icons into text-based languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      The platform also provides many lessons and article for users to learn about programming. 
      Users can upload articles or videos to their channels on the platform to teach other users. 
      The content can be teaching children the logic of programming, some abstract conceptions, 
      basic programming languages or some examples about how to achieve somethings. Video lesson can 
      be free or paid, it depends on the creators’ choice. Meanwhile, all the articles are free to 
      read but users can donate for the articles. Also, users can subscribe authors’ channel. There 
      are three hot lists, one for videos, one for articles and the authors. Their ranking depends on 
      algorithm basic on “likes”, views, reading, subscriptions and donations. The authors can get 
      paid by creating lessons and it can encourage them to create better lessons and attract more 
      users to create lessons. Of course, all then content of videos and articles must be checked by 
      platform, non-compliant, illegal or not related content are not allowed to publish. The 
      platform will warn the authors and require them to modify. If they don’t modify after few 
      times of warning, their accounts will be banned. Users can also report the content of the 
      videos or articles. The main clients of the platform are children so the platform should 
      set a good example for children.
    </p>
    <p>
      When users finish their programs or games, they can upload to the library on the platform. 
      Users can also view others’ programs or games and download them. The games or programs also 
      can be viewed in users’ channels. Users can not only donate for others’ lessons, also the 
      programs or games they written. They can leave comments and communicate with others under 
      the pages of games or programs. Adding friends is also a good choice. Communication and 
      share experience can help users learn programming better. But all these above need to follow 
      the community rules otherwise users will be banned. Besides, the platform will list the most 
      popular games and programs once a season. The author of the games or programs will get prize.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color: rgb(11, 132, 180);">Tools and Technologies:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>block‐based programming such as Scratch</li>
    </br>
      <li>a Java compiler (Eclipse or Jbuilder) to build the platform, login and register pages and so on</li>
    </br>
      <li>database (SQL server or MySQL) to save the data like account, password, programs etc</li>
    </br>
      <li>web programming (Visual Studio Code) to build the community</li>
    </br>
      <li>computers</li>
    </br>
      <li>a server to save data</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 style="color: rgb(11, 132, 180);">Skills Required:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Java font-end development---creating all the platform pages and build the interface of other components</li>
    </br>
      <li>Database---build databases to save data like account, password and retrieve data like the programs uploaded by users on the server</li>
    </br>
      <li>Web programming skills like html5, CSS, Java script to build the community for users to communicate with others.</li>
    </br>
      <li>The skill about how to transform block-based language into text-based language like C/C++, Java and so on.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="color: rgb(11, 132, 180);">Outcome:</h3>
    <p>
      If the project is successful, many children can learn programming easily on the platform. 
      For young children, they can program via dragging and dropping icons to create programs 
      which can highly attract their interest just like playing games. For advanced students, 
      they can check the basic code of icons and learn further about programming. All of them 
      can learn from the lessons on the platform and everyone would like to teach others and 
      share their experience and communicate with others. Learning programming will not be a 
      boring thing anymore. Not only children, also adults can communicate about programming and 
      new technology freely without misunderstanding and hate. More and more people would be 
      willing to learn programming and more and more programs can be written, society will be 
      better and better.
